# SPI Extracted timing

Reads routed geometry and extracted parasitics. Reports typical and slow library corners at a 20 ns reference clock. Any VIOLATED marker or negative reported slack fails acceptance.

Run from this existing stage directory in an initialized WSL Igny shell:\n\n```bash\nmake\n```\n\nThe Make recipe returns to the protocol root and invokes the actual stage-aware run_flow.sh.

See [the unit README](../README.md) for source provenance, prerequisites, interfaces, tested cases, reproduction and physical-evidence limitations. Keep the upstream licence notices. Tool-generated artifacts use their required formats; provenance is recorded in the source headers, unit README, tool lock and validation receipt rather than corrupting binary/standard-format payloads.
